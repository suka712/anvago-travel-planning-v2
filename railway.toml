# Railway configuration
# Note: For monorepo deployments, you typically create separate services in Railway
# and configure each one in the UI with the appropriate Dockerfile path.
#
# This config is for the CLIENT service. For the server, create a separate
# Railway service and set its Dockerfile path to: packages/server/Dockerfile
